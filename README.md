# SSF2 Delta - Final Re:Mix
*SSF2 Delta - Final Re:Mix* is a remaster of the **original** SSF2 Delta, initially released in 2020 - a modpack that aimed to rework the entire playable cast of SSF2 with exciting tweaks to make everyone competitively viable. The theme of the project was "change", which is why I gave it the name of Delta!

This new version aims to mostly preserve the original gameplay experience from the v1.2 release while implementing small additions and changes, such as restoring Online Mode functionality, fixing bugs, and more.

## Latest Changes: v1.2.0.1
- Restored Online Mode functionality
- Updated Waiting Room visuals
- New default and alternative menu music - check the first two options in the "Sandbox" menu!
- Updated title screen
- Compiled for 64-bit machines (this should also help/fix the old memory leak issues)
- Fixed the old issues related to META-INF/AdobeAIR/Application descriptors - the new build should just work!

### Known Issues
- Discord Rich Presence timestamps can be wildly inaccurate
